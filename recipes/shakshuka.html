    <h2 class="recipe-text">Flavorful Eggs in Tomato Sauce Served with Bread</h2>
    <p class="recipe-text">Shakshuka is a delicious and flavorful dish made with poached eggs in a rich tomato sauce. It is a popular meal in Middle Eastern and North African cuisine. The sauce is made by cooking tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices like cumin and paprika. Once the sauce is thick, eggs are gently cracked into it and cooked until the whites are set but the yolks stay runny. People often eat shakshuka with bread to scoop up the sauce and eggs.</p>
    <p class="recipe-text">Shakshuka is loved because it is easy to make, nutritious, and full of flavor. It can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and can be made spicier by adding chili peppers. Some versions include extra ingredients like cheese, bell peppers, or spinach for more variety. This dish is a perfect mix of warm, comforting flavors and is enjoyed by many people around the world.</p>
