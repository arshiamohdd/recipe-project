    <h2 class="recipe-text">A Middle Eastern Pistachio and Cheese Delicacy</h2>
    <p class="recipe-text">Kunafeh (also spelled Knafeh) is a beloved Middle Eastern dessert known for its crispy, golden layers of shredded phyllo dough (kataifi) or semolina crust, filled with gooey cheese or creamy custard. The dish is soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup, often infused with rose or orange blossom water, giving it a distinctive sweetness. It is typically garnished with crushed pistachios, adding a delightful crunch that complements the rich, buttery texture.</p>
    <p class="recipe-text">Originating from the Levant region, Kunafeh has many variations across different Middle Eastern countries. In Palestine and Jordan, it is commonly made with Nabulsi cheese, while in Egypt, a softer, cream-filled version is popular. Whether served hot and fresh from the oven or enjoyed with a scoop of ice cream, this indulgent dessert remains a staple at celebrations and gatherings, symbolizing warmth and hospitality.</p>
    <p class="recipe-text">Knafeh is one of my favorite desserts. I grew up enjoying eating knafeh during many occasions, festivities, and celebrations.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound of Kataifi (8 OZ) (half of the bag)</li>
            <li>1 pound of cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter or ghee</li>
            <li>1/4 crushed pistachios</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar syrup</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="recipe-section">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take out the frozen kataifi dough and let it thaw for 2-3 hours before using.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
            <li>Shred the cheese or cut it into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Shred the kataifi dough by placing it in a food processor or with a knife.</li>
            <li>Once shredded, place kataifi dough in a bowl and pour over melted butter and coloring (optional). Using your hands, massage the butter into the dough making sure everything is well integrated.</li>
            <li>Grease the bottom of the pan with some butter. Use a 9-inch pan. If using the entire kataifi bag, use an 18-inch pan.</li>
            <li>Spread the majority of the dough, leaving about ¼ for the top.</li>
            <li>Add shredded cheese on top, and press well either by the palm of your hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
            <li>Take the remaining kataifi dough, spread it over the cheese, and press well again either by hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the edges are deeply golden and crispy, and the cheese is melted. You can check the cheese with a fork.</li>
            <li>Take it out of the oven, and carefully flip it into another (same size or slightly larger) platter, then immediately drizzle the knafeh with about ½-¾ of the warm sugar syrup, ensuring you cover the full surface. Reserve the remaining syrup for anyone who wants extra.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle crushed pistachios on top.</li>
            <li>Cut into pieces and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
