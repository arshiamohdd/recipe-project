    <h2 class="recipe-text">A Mexican Three-Milk Soaked Delicacy</h2>
    <p class="recipe-text">Tres Leches Cake is a popular Latin American dessert known for its rich, moist texture and sweet, creamy flavor. The name "tres leches" translates to "three milks," referring to the three types of milk—evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream or whole milk—used to soak the sponge cake. This process gives the cake its signature softness and richness.</p>
    <p class="recipe-text">Typically, the cake is made from a light and airy sponge base, allowing it to absorb the milky mixture without becoming too soggy. It is often topped with whipped cream and sometimes garnished with cinnamon, fresh fruit, or caramel for added flavor. Tres Leches Cake is widely enjoyed across Latin America and has become a favorite dessert in many parts of the world due to its indulgent taste and melt-in-the-mouth texture.</p>
